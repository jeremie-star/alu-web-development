Webpage HTML Structure Implementation

Overview

This project focuses on implementing the HTML structure of a webpage based on a designer file. The task will involve creating a semantic and well-structured HTML layout, without any CSS or styling, to ensure accessibility and clarity in the markup.

Project Details

-Designer File: The webpage design is provided via Figma. You can access the final design details by duplicating the file to your drafts.
-Fonts: The project uses two specific fonts:
    .Source Sans Pro
    .Spin Cycle OT
    .if your computer doesn't have these fonts, you can find them through the provided links.
-Design Specifications: Some values in the design file are in float format. Feel free to round these values where appropriate to ensure proper layout in your HTML structure.

Objective

-Implement the HTML structure as per the design in the Figma file.
-Ensure semantic HTML by using appropriate tags for each section (e.g., <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, etc.).
-Avoid using CSS or styling in this phase; focus on the markup only.

Getting Started

-Access the Design: Create a Figma account, open the designer file, and duplicate it to your drafts to have full access to the details.
-Structure the HTML: Create a new HTML file and start implementing the page structure based on the Figma design, focusing on maintaining semantic HTML elements.
-Fonts: Make sure the fonts are applied according to the design if possible, but styling will be handled later.
